Discrete optimisation
My python code for discrete optimisation, course on coursera: https://class.coursera.org/optimization-003/
For me it was one of the first python courses and i liked it a lot.
Tasks, problems sets and my solution you can find in appropriate folders.
Marks:
Knapsack:
 Problem 1	10 / 10   value: 99798		<br>
 Problem 2  10 / 10	  value: 142156
 Problem 3	10 / 10		value: 100236
 Problem 4	 7 / 10		value: 3966813 - were too big files for my RAM, so i used another method
 Problem 5	10 / 10		value: 109899 
 Problem 6	 7 / 10		value: 1099881 - were too big files for my RAM, so i used another method
 
Graph coloring:
 Problem 1	10 / 10   value: 6		
 Problem 2  10 / 10	  value: 17 
 Problem 3	 7 / 10		value: 17 
 Problem 4	 7 / 10		value: 86
 Problem 5	 7 / 10		value: 18 
 Problem 6	 7 / 10		value: 119  
 
Travelling Salesman(for this i should use not annealing, but edge swapping algo, in free time will try to implement ^^):
 Problem 1	 7 / 10   value: 471.753014171		
 Problem 2   7 / 10	  value:  22257.8048778 
 Problem 3	 7 / 10		value: 35500.7982989
